Machine Learning Classification Project

### Project Title
Building Damage Level After an Earthquake

### Description
CLassifying the level of building damage after the Gorthka earthquake in Nepal. The classificaiton is based on building location and aspects of construction.  

### Features and Target Variables
Target: Damage Level (Low, Medium, Complete Destruction)
Features: geographic level, ground, foundation, superstructure, construction materials, number of floors, area, height, among others

### Data Used 
The data was collected through surveys by Kathmandu Living Labs and the Central Bureau of Statistics, This survey is one of the largest post-disaster datasets ever collected. We are working with a sample of 30,000.

### Tools Used 
Supervised Learning\
Streamlit

### Possible impacts of your project
The national plan of reconstruction after an earthquake can be informed by machine learning, which can help us classify remaining and new buildings depending on their level of risk. With this information thousands of lives can be saved when facing a natural disaster like the Gorthka earthquake in Nepal. That earthquake presented a ratio of 0.011 deads per building damaged (762,106 buildings where damaga and 9,000 people died). This models is able to correctly classify the level of damage if 444,666 builings. If measures are taken, there is the posibility to save almost 5000 lives. It is important to mention that in the most critical class (complete destruction), the model was able to correctly classify 71% of the buildings. Machine Learning can inform the plan of reconstruction, audit, and inspection, to save lives and resources in the face of a future earthquake.
